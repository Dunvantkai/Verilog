| Operator | Type        | Meaning                                        |                                                      |                                     |

| `&`      | Bitwise AND | Each bit of the result is 1 if both bits are 1 |                                                      |                                     |
| \`       | Bitwise OR  | Bitwise OR                                     | Each bit of the result is 1 if at least one bit is 1 |                                     |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR | Each bit is 1 if bits are different            |                                                      |                                     |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT | Inverts each bit (0→1, 1→0)                    |                                                      |                                     |
| `&&`     | Logical AND | True if **both** operands are non-zero         |                                                      |                                     |
| `!`      | Logical NOT | True if operand is zero                        |                                                      |                                     |
